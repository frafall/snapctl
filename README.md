Snapctl - snapcast control

I discovered [python-snapcast](https://github.com/happyleavesaoc/python-snapcast) and discarded
my feeble attempts on doing the same.

Now I can focus on what I really wanted.. :)

So, first test is to verify the metadata interface - and it works with unmodified
python-snapcast, check playing.py
